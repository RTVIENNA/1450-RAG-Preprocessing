        "\n",
        "- **Level**: Beginner\n",
        "- **Time to complete**: 15 minutes\n",
        "- **Goal**: After completing this tutorial, you'll have learned how to build an indexing pipeline that will preprocess files based on their file type, using the `FileTypeRouter`.\n",
        "\n",
        "> 💡 (Optional): After creating the indexing pipeline in this tutorial, there is an optional section that shows you how to create a RAG pipeline on top of the document store you just created. You must have a [Hugging Face API Key](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) for this section\n",
        "\n",
        "## Components Used\n",
        "\n",
        "- [`FileTypeRouter`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/filetyperouter): This component will help you route files based on their corresponding MIME type to different components\n",
        "- [`MarkdownToDocument`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/markdowntodocument): This component will help you convert markdown files into Haystack Documents\n",
        "- [`PyPDFToDocument`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/pypdftodocument): This component will help you convert pdf files into Haystack Documents\n",
        "- [`TextFileToDocument`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/textfiletodocument): This component will help you convert text files into Haystack Documents\n",
        "- [`DocumentJoiner`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentjoiner): This component will help you to join Documents coming from different branches of a pipeline\n",
        "- [`DocumentCleaner`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentcleaner) (optional): This component will help you to make Documents more readable by removing extra whitespaces etc.\n",
        "- [`DocumentSplitter`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentsplitter): This component will help you to split your Document into chunks\n",
        "- [`SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/sentencetransformersdocumentembedder): This component will help you create embeddings for Documents.\n",
        "- [`DocumentWriter`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentwriter): This component will help you write Documents into the DocumentStore"

Die Charité –\\nUniversitätsmedizin Berlin hat MTS als erste deutsche Universitätsklinik seit dem\\n01.04.2008 in den Notaufnahmen aller Standorte etabliert.\\nWelche Vorteile hat die Ersteinschätzung für den\\nPatienten?\\nWartezeiten in Notaufnahmen sind nicht vermeidbar, da unter anderem einerseits das\\nPatientenaufkommen hier wenig planbar ist und andererseits die personellen,\\ntechnisch-apparativen und räumlichen Ressourcen begrenzt sind. Daher können nicht\\nalle Patienten unmittelbar und gleichzeitig behandelt werden. Kritisch kranke oder\\nverletzte Patienten sollten aber nicht unnötig lange auf eine Behandlung warten\\nmüssen, während \\n\\n    des pflegekongress11 verliehen. einmalig werden ehrenamtliche helfer/innen in form eines Sonderpreises gewürdigt, die ehrenamtliche dienste anbieten (besuchsdienste, nachbarschaftshilfe in der form von einkaufbesorgung oder begleitung, ect ...). informationen, ausschreibungsunterlagen und onlineein-\\nreichung unter: www.pflegepreis.at\\nWissenschaftliche\\tPosterpräsentation\\nWir bieten ihnen auch heuer wieder die möglichkeit am pflegekongress11 ihre wissenschaftlichen Projekte in form eines Posters auszustellen und zu präsentie -\\nren. die Prämierung der besten drei Poster findet am 3. november statt. nähere informationen und richtlinien für die einreichung unter: www.pflegekongress.at\\npflegenetz.kabarett:\\tNachtdienst\\nlachen stärkt die abwehrkräfte! für einen amüsanten ausklang sorgen Peter & teutscher mit ihrem Kabarett „ nachtdienst“: dr. ronny tekal-teutscher und der begeisterte bühnen-Patient norbert Peter bringen licht ins dunkel der nacht!

Krey 2010b).\\ndas lKh - univ. Klinikum Graz hat, da das mtS überzeugt hat, dieses instrument aufgegriffen und setzt sich nun aktiv für eine ausbreitung des Systems in Österreich ein.\\nder erste Schritt in diese richtung wurde durch die aufnah-\\nme der Grazer mtS-Gruppe in die internationale referenz-\\ngruppe (irG) gesetzt (vgl. mackway-Jones et al. 2006, S.10; Krey 2010b).\\ndie Gründer/innen des britischen mtS und der internatio -\\nnalen referenzgruppe \\n\\n\\nQuestion: What does the color blue indicate?\\nAnswer:')], _name=None, _meta={})], 'generation_kwargs': None, 'tools': None, 'streaming_callback': None}\u001b[0m\n",
