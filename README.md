# 1450-RAG-Preprocessing/ The running ducks and the intelligent lama

This repository contains a RAG pipeline that preprocesses the data using Docling. Following the preprocessing phase, the pipeline utilizes DuckDuckGo to search the web when the required information cannot be extracted from the provided data. Once the relevant information is gathered, LLaMA 3.2 (3B) generates a response that is delivered to the user.
The Haystack framework was partially used to build an agentic RAG pipeline.
The preliminary pipeline can be found in the Docling_Run_1.ipynb notebook. In the upcoming period, the code will be further optimized. The final outcome will be announced once the optimization process is completed.
